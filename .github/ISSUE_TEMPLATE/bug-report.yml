        If you need help or support using React Query Builder and you are not reporting a bug, please start a [discussion topic](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/discussions/new) or join our [Discord](https://react-querybuilder.js.org/discord) server.

        If you are not running the latest version of React Query Builder, first try upgrading as it may already have been fixed.

        Minimal starter projects using the latest React Query Builder version can be found in the [`/examples` folder](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/examples). Each sub folder is a complete working project that can be loaded in CodeSandbox/StackBlitz or downloaded locally with `degit`. Instructions are in each folder's respective README file. (Note: most examples use one of the compatibility packages, but `basic` and `basic-ts` do not.)
