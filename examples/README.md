To quickly set up CodeSandbox using any of these examples as a template:

1. Navigate to the example folder (e.g. [basic-ts](./basic-ts/)) here on GitHub.
2. Change the domain of the URL from `github.com` to `githubbox.com` (just add "box" after "github") and press Enter/Return.

Your browser will be forwarded to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) with the example project preloaded.
