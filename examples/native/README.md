This example depends on [`react-native-web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-web) and uses `defaultNativeWebControlElements` for compatibility with browsers. For a native iOS or Android app, the default components provided by `QueryBuilderNative` (as defined by `defaultNativeControlElements`) would be more appropriate.
