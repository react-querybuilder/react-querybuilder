Renders a `<select>`. Used for all controls that allow the user to choose a value from a list, including the following:

- [`combinatorSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#combinatorselector)
- [`fieldSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#fieldselector)
- [`operatorSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#operatorselector)
- [`valueSourceSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#valuesourceselector)

`ValueSelector` is also the default `selectorComponent` for [`ValueEditor`](./valueeditor), used when a rule's `value` must be selected from a list.
