title: RuleGroup
description: Layout and config component for groups
---

The `RuleGroup` component allows React Query Builder to visually represent its recursive, hierarchical query structure. `RuleGroup` calls the [`useRuleGroup`](../utils/hooks#userulegroup) hook to retrieve the props it passes down to the subcomponents.

## Subcomponents

`RuleGroup` renders an outer `<div>` and two inner `<div>`s, the first containing [header elements](#rulegroupheadercomponents) (derived from the group properties) and the second containing [body elements](#rulegroupbodycomponents) (derived primarily from a map of the group's `rules` array).

:::tip

The two layout components themselves don't rely on HTML elements like `<div>`. Providing them separately allows `@react-querybuilder/native`, for example, to re-use the layout components and wrap them in a React Native `<View>`. Feel free to use them in the same way.

### `RuleGroupHeaderComponents`

This component renders the following elements in this order:

- Drag handle[^1]
- Combinator selector[^2]
- "Not" toggle[^3]
- Add rule button
- Add group button
- Clone group button[^4]
- Lock group button[^5]
- Remove group button[^6]

### `RuleGroupBodyComponents`

This component loops through a group's `rules` array and renders a child `RuleGroup` element for each group and a [`Rule`](./rule) element for each rule.

If [`showCombinatorsBetweenRules`](./querybuilder#showcombinatorsbetweenrules) is `true`, an inline combinator[^7] (whose `value` is the group's `combinator`) is rendered ahead of the rule or group.

When [`independentCombinators`](./querybuilder#independentcombinators) is `true`, each odd-numbered index in the `rules` array is a `string` representing a combinator. For those elements, an independent, inline combinator is rendered.

:::note

The `independentCombinators` prop overrides `showCombinatorsBetweenRules`.

:::

[^1]: The default styles hide this element if [`enableDragAndDrop`](./querybuilder#enabledraganddrop) is `false`, but it is _always_ rendered.
[^2]: Only rendered if neither [`showCombinatorsBetweenRules`](./querybuilder#showcombinatorsbetweenrules) nor [`independentCombinators`](./querybuilder#independentcombinators) are `true`.
[^3]: Only rendered if [`showNotToggle`](./querybuilder#shownottoggle) is `true`.
[^4]: Only rendered if [`showCloneButtons`](./querybuilder#showclonebuttons) is `true`.
[^5]: Only rendered if [`showLockButtons`](./querybuilder#showlockbuttons) is `true`.
[^6]: Only rendered if the group is not the query root.
[^7]: The [`inlineCombinator`](./querybuilder#inlinecombinator) component in turn renders the configured [`combinatorSelector`](./querybuilder#combinatorselector).
