title: ShiftActions
description: Shift up/down buttons
---

Renders a `<div>` with default styles `display: flex; flex-direction: column;` containing two `<button>` elements. When the [`showShiftActions`](./querybuilder#showshiftactions) prop is `true`, these two buttons will appear at the front of each rule and group (except the root group). The first button will shift the rule/group one spot higher, while the second will shift it one spot lower.

:::note

"Higher" and "lower" are respective of the entire hierarchy, not just the sibling objects. For example, if a subgroup is immediately below a rule, shifting the rule down will make it the first element of that subgroup.
