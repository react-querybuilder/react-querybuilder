While the `id` property can uniquely identify a rule or group, an `id` won't naturally indicate anything about the _position_ of the object within the query hierarchy. For that reason, React Query Builder uses the concept of a "path" to locate and update query objects.

The `path` property is an array of integers unique to each rule and group within a query. The query object itself (the root group) has a `path` of `[]`. All other rules and groups within the query have a `path` that corresponds to their position within the `rules` array(s) of their ancestor group(s).

The `path` of any object (rule or group) is equivalent to the `path` of its parent group, with the index of the object within its parent's `rules` array pushed onto the end. You can think of it like this: `path = [...parentPath, index]`.

Consider the following query. The respective `path` for each rule and group is commented above it, along with a short explanation.

```ts
// [] (the root group)
const query: RuleGroupType = {
  combinator: 'and',
  rules: [
    // [0] (the first, aka zeroth, element in the root rules array)
    { field: 'f1', operator: '=', value: 'v1' },
    // [1] (the second element in the root rules array is a sub-group)
    {
      combinator: 'or',
      rules: [
        // [1, 0] (the first element within the rules array
        //         of the group occupying the second position
        //         in the root rules array)
        { field: 'f2', operator: '=', value: 'v2' },
        // [1, 1] (the second element within the rules array
        //         of the group occupying the second position
        //         in the root rules array)
        { field: 'f3', operator: '=', value: 'v3' },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

The `path` of the top-most rule in the query is `[0]`, `0` being the index of that rule within the root group's `rules` array. The `path` of the first sub-group in the query is `[1]`, again according to its index within the outermost `rules` array. Each child rule of _that_ group has a path that begins with `1` (the `path` of its parent), followed by its own index.

## Finding a `path`

Use the [`findPath`](../utils/misc#findpath) function to locate a specific rule or group for examination or update. Given the query above:

```ts
findPath([1, 0], query);
```

would return this object:

```json
{ "field": "f2", "operator": "=", "value": "v2" }
```

## Example

In most scenarios you won't need to interact with the `path` attribute, but it can come in handy in certain situations. One such situation is if you need to access other parts of the query from within a custom component.

Say you have a custom value editor that needs to know the `value` of each of its sibling rules. We would recommend calling `props.schema.getQuery()` to get the query and then retrieving the sibling rules with a combination of `getParentPath` and `findPath`.

> _Prior to version 7, custom components only received props relevant to the rule or group they acted on. You could augment these default props with other data or information--the root query object, for example--by using the [`context` prop](../components/querybuilder#context)._
