## From v3 to v4

React Query Builder v4 was mainly a feature release, but changes to the structure of the rendered HTML necessitated a major version bump.

A new drag handle `<span />` element will always be rendered at the front of every rule and rule group header element, regardless of whether you enable the drag-and-drop feature. If drag-and-drop is disabled (the default setting), you should hide the drag handle by either 1) using the default stylesheet which hides it automatically when drag-and-drop is disabled, or 2) hiding it with a style rule like `.queryBuilder-dragHandle { display: none; }`.

:::tip

The default stylesheet can be loaded as CSS or SCSS:

```ts
import 'react-querybuilder/dist/query-builder.css';
// OR
import 'react-querybuilder/dist/query-builder.scss';
```

:::

If using TypeScript, custom `operatorSelector` components will need to accommodate `OptionGroup<NameLabelPair>[]` in addition to the normal `NameLabelPair[]`.

Internal methods for immutably updating queries have been moved from the `schema` prop to the new `actions` prop on both `RuleProps` and `RuleGroupProps`. Custom `<Rule />` and `<RuleGroup />` components will need to adjust their prop declarations.
