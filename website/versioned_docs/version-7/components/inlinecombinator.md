description: Wrapper element for inline combinator selectors
---

Renders the [`combinatorSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#combinatorselector) (passed in as the `component` prop; [`ValueSelector`](./valueselector) by default) nested beneath `<div class="betweenRules inline-combinator">`. Used when [`showCombinatorsBetweenRules`](./querybuilder#showcombinatorsbetweenrules) is enabled or the query is using [independent combinators](./querybuilder#independent-combinators).
