title: ValueSelector
description: Versatile selector component
---

Renders a `<select>` element. This versatile component is used for all controls that allow users to choose a value from a list, including:

- [`combinatorSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#combinatorselector)
- [`fieldSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#fieldselector)
- [`operatorSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#operatorselector)
- [`valueSourceSelector`](./querybuilder-controlelements#valuesourceselector)

`ValueSelector` also serves as the default `selectorComponent` for [`ValueEditor`](./valueeditor) when a rule's `value` must be selected from a list.
